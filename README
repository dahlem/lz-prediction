README

This application computes the log-loss on a prediction task given a
dictionary and a set of test sequences. The prediction is linked to a
related project that computes dictionaries using Lempel-Ziv parsing of
a training set of sequences [1] and is due to Nisenson et al. [2].


EXECUTION

The command-line options are as follows:

General Configuration:
  --help                    produce help message
  --version                 show the version
  --result arg (=./results) results directory.
  --sequences arg           Sequences file
  --model arg               Model file

  
The sequence file expects three columns separated by commas. The first
column gives the sequence identifier; the second column is a running
integer of the position of a string in the sequence, and the third
column is the string of the sequence. E.g.,

1,1,a
1,2,b
1,3,c
...
1,26,z

is the alphabet given as a sequence.

The dictionary (model) is contains the phrases extracted during
Lempel-Ziv parsing. Based on these phrases, a tree is created which is
queried for sub-strings of the sequences in order to compute the
log-loss.

The dictionary contains phrases where the symbols are separated by a
"<>".
